# Build Builder for MHWilds
The intent of this app is to facilitate build creation by streamlining the process of finding optimal armour pieces given desired skills.

In short, the user will enter their desired skills, and the tool will (hopefully) provide the optimal armour pieces to accommodate as many of said skills as possible, taking into account innate weapon and armour skills, as well as their deco slots and available decos

Other options will eventually include: 
- locking armour pieces
- set bonuses

This repo is the back-end of the app, featuring a database of skills, armour pieces, decos, and weapons.
